<!-- 
  Let's walk through this... line 16 defines a 'el' property that we can use to
  scope our view to a jQuery 'body' object.

  Next up, line 18 creates an 'events' block. Each key-value pair in this block
  specifies an 'element & event' and a funciton to call when the event occurs.
  In this case, we're stating that the button with ID "add" should call 
  'addItem' on click. Very good so far ...

  Next, when we instantiate a new ListView object, we will automatically invoke
  the 'initialize' function. As such, this contstructor should prepare the
  instance with whatever basic stuff it needs.

  > We have a little underscore.js going on as the first call, but i'm not 100%
  sure on what it does ... According to the official _ docs, bindAll will invoke
  all specified funcitons in the parent object's context.

  > Next, we define an a var that will act as a counter. For the purpose of this
  demo, the counter is what shows that we're interacing with the underlying code.
  That is, when the user clicks something and 'addItem' is called, the counter's
  value will incriment thereby making it obvious that the user's action is 
  modifying the underlying state of the object. 

  > Finally, we call render() to prepare the document for modification and 
  interaction. Rather than prattle on here, let's jump into Render.

  Line 27 beings the definition of the render function. Rather simply, this
  funciton will add a button and empty UL list to the el element. Note that
  the value of el was specified on line 16. This design allows the view to be
  dynamically specified by a caller (e.g. by passing el's selector as a
  constructor parameter). 

  I could go on, but it seems pretty clear what's happening here. We manually
  specify the scope of the view (in 'el'), we define the events we want to track
  in an 'events' object, create some functions to handle the heavy lifing, and 
  chain properties together such that clicking the button will invoke addItem 
  which will incriment the coutner and append the unordered list with a new 
  element.
